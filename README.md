# Features
* **COVID-19 Predictor** - The predictor model based on machine learning approach analyzes the likelihood of the disease based on various factors.

* **COVID-19 Detector** - With the help of COVID-19 Detector, you can upload your Chest X-Ray image and get a prior prediction of whether you are COVID-19 positive, negative or it's a case of Pneumonia.

* **Chatbot** - An AI assistant will resolve all your queries related to the disease and provide implementable solutions to them.

* **Current situation Overview** - Latest updates and overview of the on-going situation to help you keep track of it.

# Tech Stack
* For [COVID-19 Predictor](https://github.com/V2dha/NOvid-20/tree/master/server/covid19-predictor), Ensemble Machine Learning classifier was used to classify the symptoms and factors entered by the user. The accuracy achieved by the model is 98.2% using Random Forest. 
* For [COVID-19 Detector](https://github.com/V2dha/NOvid-20/tree/master/server/covid19-detector), Convolutional Neural Networks were used to detect the COVID-19 using Chest X-Ray images with an accuracy of 95%. 
* For both deployment of Predictor and Detector, Flask was used for backend deployment on heroku.
* Main website is a static website hosted using Github Pages with the frontend built using Bootstrap template.
* Chatbot is powered by SnatchBot.
