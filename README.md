# Features
* A **machine learning based prediction model** that would help to provide the likelihood of the disease based on various factors.

* An **deep learning based X-Rays Covid Detection** which will detect COVID-19 based on your X-Ray report.

* Current situation overview in which we would be giving the latest updates and overview of the on-going situation in the form of blogs and newsletters to help you keep track of it.

* Some useful insights i.e in addition to the above, we would also be providing useful insights from our end, which would prove to be beneficial.

# Tech Stack
1. Used Ensemble Machine Classifying methods to classify the symptoms entered by the user. The accuracy achieved by the model is 98.2% using Random Forest classifier.
2. Used flask server for the model deployment on Heroku.
3. The frontend is made using bootstrap template.


# Future Scope
1. Would work on enabling NLP on the chatbot to make it interactive for the users.
